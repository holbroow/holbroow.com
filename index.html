        <p>
            I use this site to document my work while at University. <br><br> 
            I maintain an interest in hardware in terms of servers and datacenter
            technology, and run my own Server(s), using dynamic DNS 
            services to access them from university and other locations, they prove 
            helpful as file storage solutions as well as the web server used for 
            this site. This hobby has allowed me to gain experience in running a 
            server using Windows, macOS, and even Linux, and while this experience may 
            be insignificant, I continue to enjoy the 'ins and outs' of Networks and 
            electronic connectivity between devices and people.<br><br>
            I also enjoy software development including development in C, Java 
            (which i have learnt at university), HTML, and PHP(which sparked my 
            interest in web development. While I understand and have programmed in 
            Python before, I spent many years programming using it purely, and 
            have grown bored of its simplicity compared with other programming paradigms. <br><br>
            I will graduate in 2025 or 2026 and look foward to working in the fast-paced 
            industry that is 'Tech'. <br>
